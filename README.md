we all need cricket scores to reach us as fast as possible well there are already avail api that provide us score where we cant change much of it .. the api responses walk step by step with our device scores there are many telegram groups which provide us this scroes 
way ahaed of any device or any api i though of using that message and bringing score fast to people the way to do this was sync telegram messages with the scorecard.. the problem this telegram message were often not uniform so making a parser for it was not possible hence 
we integrated ai model that undersntads and gives us a proper formatted now this proper forma of snon unifrom score is then used for updating score card and thats it..currently as i dont use aws and i have to be depdentent on external ai api call but this can be musth faster
to almost 200ms if used via our own small model or nay local lighweight model out there as this dosent requires much compution or thinking it is very easy for ai to interpret. caching of scores can be done but bczz the telegram group has so much of non uniform messages
